        <h1>Vitamin D and Immune System Health</h1>

        <p>The role of Vitamin D in maintaining immune system health has been a topic of significant research and public interest, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <div class="claim" id="claim-1">
            "Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of respiratory infections by 3-4 times, according to multiple clinical studies."
        </div>

        <p>This claim has been widely shared on social media and has led many people to start taking Vitamin D supplements. But what does the scientific evidence actually show?</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
            <p>A meta-analysis published in the British Medical Journal (2020) found that Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of acute respiratory infections by 12% in the general population.</p>
            <p>Several observational studies have shown associations between low Vitamin D levels and increased susceptibility to infections, particularly in elderly populations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contradiction">
            <h3>Contradicting Evidence</h3>
            <p>However, a large-scale randomized controlled trial (VITAL study, 2022) involving over 25,000 participants found no significant reduction in infection rates with Vitamin D supplementation.</p>
            <p>The Cochrane Review (2021) concluded that the evidence for Vitamin D preventing respiratory infections is inconclusive, with many studies showing no effect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="claim" id="claim-2">
            "90% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals were Vitamin D deficient, proving that low Vitamin D causes severe COVID-19."
        </div>

        <p>This statistic has been frequently cited as evidence for the importance of Vitamin D in fighting COVID-19. However, correlation does not equal causation.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
            <p>Several hospital-based studies during the pandemic did find high rates of Vitamin D deficiency among COVID-19 patients, particularly those requiring intensive care.</p>
            <p>Some smaller studies showed that Vitamin D supplementation might reduce disease severity in deficient patients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="contradiction">
            <h3>Contradicting Evidence</h3>
            <p>Large population studies have shown that Vitamin D deficiency is extremely common worldwide (up to 50% of populations in some regions), making it likely to appear in any hospitalized group.</p>
            <p>Randomized trials of Vitamin D supplementation for COVID-19 prevention or treatment have shown mixed or negative results, with no clear benefit demonstrated.</p>
            <p>Confounding factors like age, obesity, and comorbidities are much stronger predictors of COVID-19 severity than Vitamin D status.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The relationship between Vitamin D and immune health is complex. While deficiency should be corrected for overall health, the evidence does not support Vitamin D as a magic bullet for preventing infections or treating COVID-19.</p>
